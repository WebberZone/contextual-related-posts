### MySQL FULLTEXT indices

On activation, the plugin creates three MySQL FULLTEXT indices (or indexes), which are leveraged to find the related posts. [Learn more about how the algorithm works](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/contextual-related-posts-algorithm/).

If you're running a multisite installation, an index is created for each blog upon activation. These indices occupy space in your MySQL database but are essential for running the plugin.

Two options on the settings page allow you to remove these indices when deactivating or deleting the plugin. The latter is true by default.
