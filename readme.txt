Display related posts on your WordPress blog and feed. Supports thumbnails, shortcodes, widgets and custom post types!

== Description ==

<a href="https://webberzone.com/plugins/contextual-related-posts/">Contextual Related Posts</a> is a powerful plugin for WordPress that allows you to display a list of related posts on your website and in your feed.

The list is based on the content of the title and/or content of the posts which makes them more relevant and more likely to be of interest to your readers. This allows you to retain visitors, reduce bounce rates and refresh old entries.

Contextual Related Posts is one of the most feature rich related posts plugins for WordPress with support for thumbnails, shortcodes, widgets, custom post types, caching and CSS styles.

The plugin also comes with it's very own inbuilt stylesheet that let's your related posts look awesome!

= Key features =

* **Automatic**: CRP will start displaying related posts on your site and feed automatically after the content when you activate the plugin. No need to edit template files
* **Manual install**: Want more control over placement? Check the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contextual-related-posts/faq/">FAQ</a> on which functions are available for manual install.
* **Widgets**: Add related posts to widgetized area of your theme. Lots of options available
* **Shortcode**: Use `[crp]` to display the posts anywhere you want in the post content
* **The algorithm**: Find related posts by title and/or content of the current post
* **Caching**: Related posts output is automatically cached as visitors browse through your site
* **Exclusions**: Exclude posts from categories from being displayed in the list. Or you can exclude posts or pages by ID
* **Custom post types**: The related posts list lets you include posts, pages, attachments or any other custom post type!
* **Thumbnail support**:
	* Support for WordPress post thumbnails. CRP will create a custom image size (`crp_thumbnail`) with the dimensions specified in the Settings page
	* Auto-extract the first image in your post to be displayed as a thumbnail
	* Manually enter the URL of the thumbnail via <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields">WordPress meta fields</a>. Specify this using the meta box in your Edit screens.
	* Optionally, use timthumb to resize images or use your own filter function to resize post images
* **Styles**: The output is wrapped in CSS classes which allows you to easily style the list. You can enter your custom CSS styles from within WordPress Admin area or use the style included.
* **Customisable output**:
	* Display excerpts in post. You can select the length of the excerpt in words
	* Customise which HTML tags to use for displaying the output in case you don't prefer the default `list` format
* **Extensible code**: Several actions and filters to modify the output, add more options, etc.

= How can I customise the output? =

Several customization options are available via the Settings page in WordPress Admin. You can access this via <strong>Settings &raquo; Related Posts</strong>

The plugin also provides you with a set of CSS classes that allow you to style your posts by adding code to the *style.css* sheet. In a future version, I will be adding in CSS support within the plugins Settings page.

The following CSS classes / IDs are available:

* **crp_related**: ID of the main wrapper `div`. This is only displayed on singular pages, i.e. post, page and attachment

* **crp_related**: Class of the main wrapper `div`. If you are displaying the related posts on non-singular pages, then you should style this

* **crp_title**: Class of the `span` tag for title of the post

* **crp_excerpt**: Class of the `span` tag for excerpt (if included)

* **crp_thumb**: Class of the post thumbnail `img` tag

For more information, please visit https://webberzone.com/plugins/contextual-related-posts/

= How does the plugin select thumbnails? =

The plugin selects thumbnails in the following order:

1. Post Thumbnail image: The image that you can set while editing your post in WordPress &raquo; New Post screen

2. Post meta field: This is the meta field value you can use when editing your post. The default is `post-image`

3. First image in the post: The plugin will try to fetch the first image in the post

3. Video Thumbnails: Meta field set by <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/video-thumbnails/">Video Thumbnails</a>

4. Default Thumbnail: If enabled, it will use the default thumbnail that you specify in the Settings screen

The plugin uses <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/">timthumb</a> to generate thumbnails by default. Depending on the configuration of your webhost you might run into certain problems. Please check out <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2010/11/timthumb-hints-tips/">the timthumb troubleshooting page</a> regarding permission settings for the folder and files.

= Manual install =

The following functions are available in case you wish to do a manual install of the posts by editing the theme files.

**echo_ald_crp( $args = array() )**

Echoes the list of posts wherever you add the this function. You can also use this function to display related posts on any type of page generated by WordPress including homepage and archive pages.

Usage: `<?php if(function_exists('echo_ald_crp')) echo_ald_crp(); ?>` to your template file where you want the related posts to be displayed.


**get_crp_posts_id()**

Takes a post ID and returns the related post IDs as an object.

Usage: `<?php if(function_exists('get_crp_posts_id')) get_crp_posts_id( array( 'postid' => $postid, 'limit' => $limit ) ); ?>`

Parameters:

*$postid* : The ID of the post you'd like to fetch. By default the current post is fetched. Use within the Loop for best results.

*$limit* : Maximum number of posts to return. The actual number displayed may be lower depending on the matching algorithm and the category / post exclusion settings.


= Shortcodes =

You can insert the related posts anywhere in your post using the `[crp]` shortcode. The plugin takes three optional attributes `limit`, `heading` and `cache` as follows:

`[crp limit="5" heading="1" cache="1"]`

*limit* : Maximum number of posts to return. The actual number displayed may be lower depending on the matching algorithm and the category / post exclusion settings.

*heading* : By default, the heading you specify in **Title of related posts:** under **Output options** will be displayed. You can override this by specifying your own heading e.g.

`
<h3>Similar posts</h3>
[crp limit="2" heading="0"]
`
*cache* : Cache the output or not? By default the output will be cached for the post you add the shortcode in. You can override this by specifying `cache=0`

= Filters =

The plugin includes the following filters that allows you to customise the output for several section using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter">add_filter</a>.

*crp_heading_title* : Filter for heading title of the posts. This is the text that you enter under *Output options > Title of related posts*

*crp_title* : Filter for the post title for each of the related posts

I'll be adding more filters eventually. If you are looking for any particular filter do raise a post in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contextual-related-posts">support forum</a> requesting the same.
