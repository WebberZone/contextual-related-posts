# GitHub Action: whenever creating a new release of the source code,
# also create a release of the installable plugin.
# Steps to execute:
# - Checkout the source code
# - Run "composer install" to download all dependencies under vendor/
# - Create a .zip file, excluding:
#   - All hidden files (.git, .gitignore, etc)
#   - All development files, ending in .dist
#   - All composer files <= after installing dependencies, no need for them anymore
#   - Markdown files concerning development
#   - Folder build/ <= created only to store the .zip file
#   - Folder dev-helpers/ <= not needed for the plugin
# - Upload the .zip file as an artifact to the action (this step is possibly optional)
# - Upload the .zip file as a release, for download
