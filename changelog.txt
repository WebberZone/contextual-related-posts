    * New parameter `more_link_text` that can be passed to `get_crp()` which holds the "read more". Recommended option to customize the more link text using the filter `crp_excerpt_more_link_text` or the more link element using `crp_excerpt_more_link`
    * Three new styles: "Masonry" (like Pinterest), "Grid" and "Rounded thumbnails with CSS grid". Might not work with older browsers

    * Use `wp_img_tag_add_srcset_and_sizes_attr()` to generate srcset and sizes attributes. The original code to display the srcset and sizes attributes will continue to be used

    * CRP_MAX_WORDS has been reduced to 100
    * Dropped the need for FULLTEXT index on post_content which should save some database space
